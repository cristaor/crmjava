<p>
The distributed cache is used for keeping a local copy of frecuently accesed data
at the web or apllication server reducing database accesses.
</p>
The hole distributed cache structure is composed by a number or nodes (peers) and,
possibly, a central cache coordinator.
<p>
The cache coordinator is not necessary if you only have one client peer,
or if different peers do not share any data that may be changed at runtime.
</p>
<p>
If there are multiple cache clients concurrently caching and updating 
the same data, for example in a web server farm where all web server use the same
centralized database, then it will be necessary to install the cache coordinator
in an application server such as JBoss or another EJB container accesible throught RMI.
<br>
The cache coordinator is supplied in a different package from cache client as both
components are to be installed on different machines.
